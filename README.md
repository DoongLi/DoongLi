### Hi! üëè, I'm Damon Dong Li (Êùé‰∏ú)

‚ú®**Let's explore some unpredictable things together!**



üíºI'm a Research Assistant from [The Intelligent Machine Research Lab (IMRL)](https://sites.google.com/view/huikonglab/home) in [SKL-IOTSC](https://skliotsc.um.edu.mo/), the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), supervised by Prof. [Hui Kong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/people/huikong/). I'm broadly interested in the overlap between robotics and computer vision, Specifically, my research focuses the on use Deep learning to solve the real problems of Robotics applications.

Before that, I received the B. Eng. degree from the [School of Computer and Information Engineering](http://ci.hfut.edu.cn/), [Hefei University of Technology](http://www.hfut.edu.cn/) in June 2022. During my undergraduate years, I was the founder of the robotics team of Hefei University of Technology and participated in [RoboMaster Robotics Competition](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US), from 2019 to 2021. I worked as a Research Assistant for one year from 2022-2023, in AMAS-LAB at [the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) of [Southern University of Science and Technology(**SUSTech**)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), supervised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
